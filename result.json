{"text": " Yeah, did you hear that? What the heck was that? I have to speak English. It's for some English-speaking thing. They called me and asked me to do it. I said, heck yeah, I'll call somebody. It's for some English-speaking thing. It's going to be recorded for people. It's a study. They want to study dialects or something. I don't know. Hey, how are things? You're the branch president, huh? Okay, I'm the branch president. How'd you know? Hey, I'm telling you. I can go and get around. What's going on down there? Oh, we're having a great time. We're producing material and our investors are coming down. They're coming down here Friday, so we're getting things around for them to get down here. What are you trying to do? Oh, just getting our things around. They're coming down here Friday, so we're getting things around for them to get down here. What are you trying to do? Oh, just getting our things around. They're coming down here and getting our paperwork in line, just so we can show them what's going on. They're coming down in a few months. What are you doing? We have our aggregate processing plant, our sunny night. Is it working out okay? Uh-huh. It's working out well. Where are you living? I'm living here in Oswa, about a mile from the beach down on, like you're going towards the beach in Oswa. Like down, what's that street called? Monte Rio. Yeah, Monte Rio. So you live down where those lights are? Yeah, we live in a nice home. Did you build it? Did you buy a house? No, we were just renting. And we brought all of our stuff down, what's that street called? Monte Rio. Yeah, Monte Rio. So you were down with those guys? Yeah, we were in a nice home. Did you build, did you buy a house? No, we were just renting. And we brought all of our stuff down, so. Are you sure it's going to be good? For a few years. My gosh. At least after a few years we'll figure it out. Patty's still about due. She's going to deliver the capital. We're going to have to go move into the capital for about a month. She's got a few weeks. She's due the 5th of April. We went home here in January. And stayed for a few weeks. And are you liking it? Is it going good? Yeah, we have. It's a big change. It's a lot different than we are here. There's a little bit, a lot more things to, well, there's a lot of things to do. It's better than we are down here. I like that. Do you have electricity outside anyway? Well, we do because we brought down an electric generator. Lately, we've had a lot of electricity. Right at first, in August, September, October, it was really bad down here. But the generator, at least, we're taking care of. It's your wife, I am. Do you like it, honey? Yeah, I do. I like it better. She likes to say it's better here. She likes to say it's better, but she goes, yeah the generator at least was taken care of. This is your wife, I am. Do you like it, honey? She likes to say it's better here. She likes to say it's better, but she goes, yeah, she does. It's just different. How's the branch? How do you like the branch? You know, I really enjoyed it down here, to tell you the truth. I just, um, it's been extra busy, but, um, the people are great. Patty loves the people. We have a Spanish teacher come in. She basically gets Spanish instruction every day. She has a Spanish tutor Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and then she has, on Tuesday and Thursday, do you remember her, Mana Lopez? Mm-hmm. I think she's a member when, she was, when, she might have been a member when we were here. I can't remember if she was. She's been in church for a little bit, but she's, and then she has, on Tuesday and Thursday, do you remember Germana Lopez? I think she's a member when, she might have been a member when we were here. I can't remember if she was, but she's been in church for a little bit, but she's, uh, she comes on Tuesdays and Thursdays and reads, uh, teaches Patty to read. Basically just goes over the, uh, the page. I don't read. In Spanish. Man, Jay, I can't read. You do have a car, don't you? Uh-huh, yeah, we brought our coursebook down. You brought your car down too? Uh-huh. What did it cost you to go down there? Quite a few thousand dollars. Are you making any money? Yeah, we're making, we're making good money. Good. So, starving or nothing down there? No a few thousand dollars. Are you making any money? Yeah, we're making good money. Good. So, starving or nothing down there? No, we're not starving at all. We're eating stretch and imagination. We're starting a new project out in the east. President Sorensen's going to be involved with us. Oh, good. Some of his family members are going to invest with some things. We're doing basically a little bit larger project than we're doing right here in the south. And with some other people. So it's going to be a pretty big project in the east. So we're doing well and doing other things. We're going to start to do some things. And try not to get too busy. Try not to overdo it. I like the fact that, you know, starting to do some things, and trying not to get too busy. Trying not to overdo it. I like the fact that, you know, working with the Dominican people again, I really miss, when I first started coming down here traveling and selling equipment with Arsenio, you know, I just, I felt fulfilled again. It felt like I was missing something. Not that I have any stretch of imagination, it felt like I had to come back on a mission. It's just that I feel like I do a lot more here. I feel like I make more of a difference. We felt like, I both felt when we moved back from Southern Illinois, back to our home for the last couple years, that it was much easier to get into the loop of just going to our callings and doing different things, just not really doing a lot. And it's been really fun to get down here and get right back in the fire and start getting people ready for the temple. It's coming, isn't it? Yeah, it's coming pretty soon. Well, as soon as I can see my way clear, I'm coming down to see you. Oh, good deal. I've got three months of school. I've got to take, I'm probably going to be down in the Las Vegas area and start up a practice. Why there? Huh? Why there? I just feel like that's where I'm supposed going to go to Las Vegas area and start up a practice. Why there? Huh? Why there? I just feel like that's where I'm supposed to go. That's where I'm going. Do you know people there? No. That's the whole point. People say you like the area? No. Why are you going there? Well, because that's where I feel like I should be. That's all I can tell you, Jay. Oh, great. I'm just going to ask your wife how you feel about it. Same way I do, so. We're going to get down there, huh? Huh? How'd you come to pick that area out? Well, we've been thinking, we want to go somewhere in the west. Uh-huh. We're kind of looking at our options, and we feel like we should go down to Arizona or Utah or where I'm from. You know, we just started looking at cities all the time. We went out there this past summer, and then we decided that's where we should be. It'd be hard to think of a matter of... Leave your word? Yes. Yes or no. This bishop duty is, uh, well, maybe you don't know. It's hard stuff, huh? It's a weighty calling. I heard you've done a really great job. Everybody loves you so much. I don't know. I don't know about that, but that's what I'm doing. But like I said, as soon as I see my way clear, that's where we're going. We're going to take a trip down there. How's your ward doing? Doing good. Is it? We had a real good Sunday last week. We're starting to really pick up our ward and find our branch. I've been ranch president for about three, four months, three months. Our son was called to be the elders' corn president this Sunday. That'll save you a lot of hassle. Yeah. We were both so tremendously busy. I was worried about our schedules. We were both in the plant so much that I called him to be the first counselor in the young men's presidency. We don't have a really wealth of elders. We really had to start working with the first counselor in the Young Men's Presidency. We don't have a wealth of elders. We only had a first counselor and a secretary. No second counselor. We basically had five or six guys that tried to share all the load. The guy load, anyway. We had a lot of good South-Spanish women besides Faye and Betty and Rosemary. So anyway, our setting was called this week. We had two or three elders that we just recently reactivated there. And we only missed two elders out of our entire elders quorum. We're all excited about it. Yeah, it's going to come around. We had a lot of good growth. We had a couple of new families baptized. How's it going, Dom? I don't want to depress you, but it's fine. It's just that everyone has good intentions. It's not our mission by any stretch of the imagination. It's not even Dom's. It's so far from our mission. Daddy has this in me. That's her. She'll start chuckling when I start going off and going off. She says, oh, yeah, your mission's the greatest. And I love you the whole thing. I'm telling you. We know. It's the point where it gets you so depressed. I've had a couple talks with the mission president. I can see exactly why our son was getting so depressed and really frustrated. A lot of strong church members were really getting really, really bent out of shape. There's just no organization. I mean, it's just a... You go down to the Cone Bay. You go down to... Anyway, you go in the Capitol, you'll find 15 missionaries. On P-days, non-P-Days, in-close, out-of-close, Burger King. We didn't even have any, did we? I can't even picture it. I don't know how to even... I don't know how to relate it. I don't know how to... What's the fact of it? I haven't talked to him a lot about that. Obviously, I didn't want to all of a sudden get in a position where all of a sudden he says, well, if you can fix it, why don't I call you to... I don't know if I can fix it. All I have time is to complain. So I do all my... I'm a complainer. I'm a complainer. I'm a complainer. Sign me up. Exactly. I want to be the critic. Well, whater. I'm a complainer. Sign me up. Exactly. I just want to be the critic. Well, what you're saying is, from what I get your message, you're looking at what was accomplished and what it is, and it's something to be sought after. You know, there's some good ones out here. There's a handful of them that want to do the right thing. Yeah, you go through our mission and tell me who wasn't good. I know. Exactly. There's a handful that weren't. You don't want to advertise more than most of us. A handful that weren't. A very, very small number. I'm pretty glad you tried to do what was right. We had a discussion. I have a contra working with us out here. Oh, do you? Uh-huh. He's out here now. He's living out in our office apartment. So he's in a different branch. But he's out at the Corral's one present and now in another branch. The district's really doing super now. We're starting to get... Who's the district president? A gentleman by the name of Felix. A really, really super guy. Just that he's really... He's a farmer at heart. What is our senior? The district president, he just really has a hard time. just that he's really, um, he's a farmer at heart and... What's your name? Just your presidency, just really has a hard time. No, just your least, I don't know what to say. Just your least, you know, a couple years back. Well, he was there for a long time, wasn't he? Yeah, he was there for a long time. Yeah, a long time, probably. His traveling was very, very difficult, too, because at the time, for the last five, ten years, he's been traveling to the east during the whole week and come back on Fridays and would leave back on Monday morning, so it was... You know, he's still a long time. Yeah, I sent you his district president before, Felix. He's a hard worker. Yeah, I think he was getting really red. I don't need a break. I don't know. I don't think he really needs a break. I don't think he... Our son is not really a guy who breaks. I think he does better loaded. Yeah. I do too. I feel like that. I feel like I do. I don't even know. I complain even then. I feel like I always need a vacation, but I really need more. More fresh. I kind of get that. What you need is you need a day off now and again, but you gotta get a day off. That's all it takes. Those breaks came present. I haven't seen him for a long time. And he's coming back down here in April. Where's he at? I'm so. I tried to talk to him. I talked to Sister Sorenson. I don't know if you heard about this, but my dad got killed last month. What? Yeah. I'm so sorry. No, I didn't know your dad. I feel so horrible. I didn't know that. He was driving out by a window over in oldest Bronco. Anyway, I talked to Sister Sorenson. She said President Sorenson was down hunting somewhere. Down in Mexico or something. Yeah, that would have been a tough deal for us. Didn't try to say that to depress you, Jay. No, I know. I just feel real bad. I know it's going to be awful. Yeah, would you please tell them for me? Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. deal for us. I didn't try to say that to depress you, Jay. No, I know, I just feel real bad. I know it's going to be awful. Yeah, would you please tell them for me? Yeah, it was a terrible deal. But we're doing okay. You know, we're doing okay. Okay, we're sticking through there. How's your mom? Well, she's taking her off. Does she have things in mind? Are they going to be able to make it? Of course. You wouldn't want't know how to turn a hand right any time. No, not that way. But sometimes, you know how life goes. Sometimes you're in positions where, you know. Yeah, but he was, he always had things under control. He made it. He had a lot of younger brothers and sisters. I got three sisters. How are they? They're doing pretty good. Wasn't there just one still at home? No, no. He just got married. Did he get married? He was married. Oh, I'm so sorry. Yeah, it's been a tough thing, Jay. I'll tell you what. We're making it. Yeah, if you could tell them for me, I know we're going to feel terrible. I almost hate to even tell them, you know? Yeah, I know. It's bad. I mean, I'll make sure you know that you tell them we're doing okay. I know we're not worried about that. You're almost done. You've only got two months left. Right. Dr. Dow. That's been a hard, hard haul. Let me tell you. You're done, though, man. Hey, that's a hard haul, but you don't have to go back and do it again. That's right. That's right. I hope I can start reading some words and women a little bit. I'm sick of it. What can we do to convince you guys to come down here for a couple years? Do dentistry? Hey, you can do the ministry of dentistry down here. I'll tell you what. I might get involved with you guys now that I'm sick of it. What can we do to convince you guys to come down here for a couple years? Do dentistry? There's going to be a ministry of dentistry down here. I might get involved with you guys now that I'm getting going. I'll have to get rolling a little bit. I'm coming. I don't know what's going on. Good deal. I really wanted to do that. At least in your situation, your wife surely knows the country as well. We're coming down for sure. How are the kids? Hey, we're doing good. Brady? How's Brady doing? I'll never forget the name of Brady. Say you'll call Corbin Brady. She hasn't done it for a long time. Right at first she had the hardest time. Oh Brady! I'll go Brady. She'll go I mean, I mean. We have another one too. Colby. Did I tell you that? Colby? Uh huh. How do you spell that? C-O-L-B-Y. Oh wow. Colby. We're gonna have another one too. When? Well we don't know on due date yet. Sometime. Hey sometime. You know. Have you heard about anyone else having a bad breakup, huh? With Chadderly. Have you heard anything about that? I have not heard anything. I don't know who that is. We don't either. I mean, our son-in-law asked me once in a while. I said, I don't have to find this out. He was really worried about when they went out west. He thought that Chadderly, I know that they had some problems, you know, between them. And I thought they'd work it out. Yeah. I think you had told me that or someone had told me that. No, I didn't even know. He has no news to me. Well, I don't know when someone had told me that. I don't know. Someone had told me that one time and it seemed like they'd work things out. And our son-in-law, when he saw him or whatever, it just seemed like he was really, um, struggling. And I don't even have a clue. You know, his parents moved. And I don't, I don't know. Maybe people will be able to get us information at the, uh, the next conference here that's coming up. And they have one at the door somewhere, somewhere around then. I'm gonna have to get right a fax out to Sister Soren's or someone to get all the questions that I want. All the people I want to know to get tracked down so people can ask around. Because I haven't been to one of them. I've never, they always had them in the temple that people will come down. I'm coming down for sure. It's incredible. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm just running my spot right now. There you go. You got it. We'll sit around and drink Kikea. Chad, it's going to be so great. I just gave you the evil eye. You don't like that, huh? Kikea. I don't drink Kikea. I drink Presidente. Oh, sorry. Presidente. I'll drink Kikea. You drink Presidente. It's the time that we're. I'm just giving you the evil eye. You don't like that, huh? Keep going. I don't drink this. I drink Presidente. Oh, sorry. Presidente. I drink Presidente. It's the time that we're all sitting around and drink Presidente. Thank you, Skaget. Mata India. Mata India. Mata India. So Beverly. Hey, do you guys have a name? Yes, we do. She's a member of the church. She has a large family. They live behind their largest restaurant, as is most people on our branch. How many branches are there? Three? There's four branches on our branch. How many branches are there? Three? There's four branches in Oslo. This is the fourth branch, and there's two buildings, and we are now the Colonial Branch, which basically was all the fishermen up in the... pretty much by Arsenio's neighborhood. Well, that's a pretty good area, though. You come down there, and I come down your street. Uh-huh. Well, my street is iffy of whether I should be in one branch or not. The district president said I was in the Colonial, and that's where I stayed, because everyone was half and half deciding whether or what branch I should be in. The district president made the decision where I should be in, but there's really no one on my street in the branch. Oh, darn. So how much does it cost to live down there? What's the exchange rate now? Is it bad? It's $13.5 exchange. I don't know. For example, this home, we're renting for about $300 American dollars a month. So not expensive at all. No. No. But then we don't pay a lot for electricity. We pay maybe less than $300 American dollars a month. So not expensive at all. No. Huh? No. It's just like a small apartment. But then we don't pay a lot for electricity. We pay maybe less than $100 for electricity. We have our air conditioners and our fans and things. We pay nothing hardly for water or anything else. But that doesn't basically go in the utility. So you're in a pretty nice home. Uh-huh. We put $1,000, probably at least $1,500 into the home. We got it. We rewired the home. And I put a little blockhouse outside to do that. And doing the things that we did all around to make it nice. We sprayed the home. What's that? What's the air conditioning there? Air conditioning. We brought it down an entire container full of all of our things. We brought in all of our furniture and our beds and our air conditioners and all of Corbin's toys and clothes. It was basically filled with containers. And Patty put some borders. There's things that when we move out of here, we'll never be able to recoup. I won't take the wire out of the home. But as long as we can stay here a couple years, paying $300 a month is fine. We paid $400, $450 in Rosetta, Ohio, and had a, you know, half the size of a home. But just... It's a nice home. There's nothing at all wrong with it. But it's not a palace, either. You know, it has... There's three bedrooms. We have two bathrooms. We have a kitchen, a living room, a dining room, and a nice porch out front. We have a tree in the back. It's a real nice neighborhood. I don't know. I can get it out. I'll do that. So it's not bad at all. The cost of living... The horrible thing is, like, when we go into the Capitol and buy groceries, like, today, I was in the Capitol, so I brought home a bunch of groceries, and we have a freezer, and along with our freezer and refrigerator, so we can keep products, um, because in Oswego you still don't have a supermarket or anything. You have one, but it just doesn't have the products. We'll go in and buy like $100 worth of meat or the crack and stuff, so we can always have good quality things, and our American products cost just like a day in the mission, you know, they're real expensive, but, um, we'll eat a bunch of Dominican things, and of course those aren't expensive at all. Um, it just depends. I mean, one day we'll eat American, one day, tonight we had ravioli, but lunchtime we had mochile, so I mean, I had mochile. I was Utah or Iowa, but it wouldn't be more. I mean, I know that for sure. I mean, I know that for sure. You pay less, and it balances out. So live like an American down here. It balances out because the things that you save on, you know, but if you lived like a Dominican, you never had American products, and it'd be that much cheaper. Diapers. Yeah, like diapers. We took diapers down here. We brought, like, we never had to buy diapers or any baby products. My brother comes down here every month. We were here the other month. And we came home. We came back. We brought, you know, we just make sure we do all our shopping up in the States and do those type of things. We can't do that, and you probably, you know, spend a lot more, but because we get that luxury, we don't spend as much money as probably a lot of those things. I mean, we do. I guess you really don't have to have them because there's people living in cardboard houses. Maybe one would be $92, but we feel like we need them. Well, you're used to them. You can afford them. You bet. Yeah, that's all. That's all we're going to have. We have some kids down there in the middle of our apartment. We could be with them. No, you can't do that. No, you can't. You might not do that. It's not. No, why would you want to do that? You wouldn't. No way. It takes the whole fun of coming down here. I mean, we have a maid, and Patty didn't know she'd really like that. She's worked out real well. It's hard to have someone in your home. But we have her come in. She comes in around 9, 9.30, and she leaves by about 3. So she'll come in and help. She'll help make lunch, and then she'll clean up and make sure that all the bathrooms and the floors are mopped because it's all tile floors. Yeah. And make sure everything's clean, and then she goes. So she'll watch Corbin while Patty's getting her Spanish lesson, and she'll do those things, and then she'll leave. And we have the washer and dryer down here, so basically she doesn't have to do a lot of cleaning. We don't have to do the dishes. We have just the hand washing. So Patty will put the things she'll leave. And we have the washer and dryer down here, so basically she doesn't have to do a lot of cleaning. We don't have, like, an emission. We have just a hand washing. So Patty will put the things in the washer. She knows how to use the dryer. She irons. And she says, I mean, she works hard, but it's not like she's here from 7 in the morning until 7 at night like people do and all those type of things. And plus, we brought her, but she loves it here. She went and traded. We did her vacation this week. She had a couple-week vacation. We went to the States. She has a good job. We live a lot. Louis, can you get back from his mission? Come back to me in the next month. Come around, baby. He's going to be in the young man's presence. He already has his calling inspired. No, do you worry. 28th is his homecoming from his mission? Comes back to you in the next month. Come around, baby. He's going to be in the young man's presence. He already had his calling inspired. No, gee, we're 28th. This is his homecoming, and by the 29th, he'll have his calling. No, that's what we call it. You're a visionary now, aren't you? Yes, I am. Let me tell you. The inspiration already got me on the calendar. The moment I was brought in, I was like, where's Louis C. going to go? Immediately, when he gets back. We saw him at Christmas time. I cheated, of course, and did a 1996 missionary thing and decided to go up. We took up all his Christmas packages, and I snuck up and saw him and took him out to dinner. We didn't get to go home for Christmas. Yes, I know. I got to confess. Don't be confessing. Well, I didn't break any rules. He did. I'm a variable. I guess I don't know how you look at it. He's a great missionary. He's grown. He's a man. It's amazing to see it. It's crazy. It was even fantastic to see him before he left on his mission. But it's just funny to see him. He looks a lot more like Arsenio. I don't know. It's funny to see the kids growing up. There's Betty and Rosemary. And even Joanna, how little she was. Now she's 14, she's bigger than all the other kids and she beats them all up. So that's... Well, Jay, my time's about up here. Um, I appreciate you talking to me. Hey, thanks for calling. Hey, I thought about that. Using us as a 30-minute telly, that's a lot of money here. It is. It works out great for me. That's a $30 bill right there.
